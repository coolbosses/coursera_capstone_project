1.Data Collection with Web Scraping
  * Web scrap Falcon 9 launch records with BeautifulSoup:
     - Extract a Falcon 9 launch records HTML table from Wikipedia
     - Parse the table and convert it into a Pandas data frame

2.Data wrangling
  * Perform exploratory Data Analysis
  * Determine Training Labels

3.Overview of the DataSet(SQL)
  * Store the dataset in a Db2 database
  * Execute SQL queries to observe the insights of the data

4.Exploring and Preparing Data
  * Perform exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering using Pandas and Matplotlib

5.Launch Sites Locations Analysis with Folium
  * Mark all launch sites on a map
  * Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map
  * Calculate the distances between a launch site to its proximities

6.Build a Dashboard Application with Plotly Dash
  * Add a Launch Site Drop-down Input Component
  * Add a callback function to render success-pie-chart based on selected site dropdown
  * Add a Range Slider to Select Payload
  * Add a callback function to render the success-payload-scatter-chart scatter plot

7.Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
  * Perform exploratory Data Analysis and determine Training Labels
      - create a column for the class
      - Standardize the data
      - Split into training data and test data
  * Find best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees and Logistic Regression
  * Find the method performs best using test data
